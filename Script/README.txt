Done processing.  Work performed:
4 file elements and 0 m4 elements added to ../Circuito/DOM-32RF.pcb.

Next step:
1.  Run pcb on your file ../Circuito/DOM-32RF.pcb.
    You will find all your footprints in a bundle ready for you to place
    or disperse with "Select -> Disperse all elements" in PCB.

2.  From within PCB, select "File -> Load netlist file" and select 
    ../Circuito/DOM-32RF.net to load the netlist.

3.  From within PCB, enter

           :ExecuteFile(../Circuito/DOM-32RF.cmd)

    to propagate the pin names of all footprints to the layout.
